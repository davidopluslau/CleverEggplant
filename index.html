        <div id="about" class=hideable>
          <p>The Clever Eggplant is David's bartending project, (typically) an informal bar at StartX, which is Stanford's startup incubator.</p>
          <p>In May 2014, David, a newly employed software developer, got pulled into one of Weeby's weekly game nights at StartX. There, he started volunteering as their for the next year. Afterward, he worked as a bartender at the Mountain View restaurant Bushido Izakaya.</p>
          <p>At the start of this summer, Ivy finished her first year of her master's degree at Duke and came to LinkedIn as a software development intern. When asked by the company about her interests, she broadcasted her developing curiosity about cocktails. David saw this and met with her, eventually spending the following two months teaching her everything he knew about bartending.</p>
          <p>This summer has just about come to its end; David has nothing left to teach Ivy. Tonight is at once a test of Ivy's growth, a showcase of her abilities, and a celebration to conclude a great season.</p>

                <div class=description>David is a software engineer at LinkedIn. He's also a former (retired?) bartender at <a href="http://www.bushidoizakaya.com/">Bushido Izakaya</a>. He drinks sparingly while bartending, as he ironically has embarrassingly unimpressive alcohol tolerance. Outside of building software for work and recreationally bartending, he powerlifts recreationally, built and maintains this website, and enjoys reading books at coffee shops during weekends.

                <div class=description>Rachel is the office manager for Weeby.co, a software startup that builds a game engine and games for their platform. Besides keeping her colleagues alive at the office, she puts together Weeby's game nights at StartX's facility, even when The Clever Eggplant is not in session. Every week she pulls together game nights with dozens of attendees and arranges enough food to feed all of them. Bar weeks present further challenges: she prints the night's menu and stocks the bar with citrus and sodas and herbs and liquors and frequent one-off ingredients. Rachel may not be the face of the bar, but she is its invaluable backbone, and without her there would be no game nights at all. Outside of work, Rachel enjoys running outdoors and dancing at clubs.

                <div class=description>Stephanie is the visual designer for Jelli, Inc., a startup that produces a cloud-based ad platform for radio. When David wanted to build new logos and redesign the menu, he turned to his high school friend for her professional expertise. Stephanie put in many hours to build numerous revisions of The Clever Eggplant's logo, art assets, typography, and layout. Everything that makes the menu and website beautiful is a piece of her work.

        <div id="faqs" class=hideable>
          <p class=question>Why are we The Clever Eggplant?</p>
          <p>The bar was nameless for its first six months of operation. Our name reflects our origins as a supporting fixture of StartX's board game nights. One night, a few of us were playing Apples to Apples. David played the green card "Clever", prompting the other players to choose cards that they thought were evocative of cleverness. One of his friends had no good answers and played "Eggplant" in response to get rid of an otherwise useless card. The ludicrous combination of those cards amused David so much that he made it the name of the bar.</p>
          <!--
          <p class=question>Does David work for StartX?</p>
          <p>No, and neither does Rachel, for that matter. Rachel's company, Weeby, graduated from StartX's startup incubation program, which is how she is affiliated with them. Likewise, David has a friend whose company also graduated from StartX, which is how David was introduced to game nights. Neither David nor his company have any affiliation with StartX. He simply mixes there on their good graces.</p>
          -->
          <p class=question>How did David start bartending?</p>
          <p>His mixing began when he received a mixology book for his birthday. He likes to say that reading the book and watching Youtube videos accounts for 10% of his skill and knowledge, while the other 90% comes from patrons at the bar bombarding him with drink requests until he could handle them all.</p>
